## Development
The app was carefully and skillfully engineered by our team. We drew inspiration from our gaming experiences and the common issue of not drinking sufficient water among individuals who lead hectic lifestyles, like us.

Hopefully, with a simple app like this it could help individuals avoid the discomfort and medical expenditure arising from aforementioned ailments that dehydration - however mild - entails. 

##### No AI, No Problem
In this day and age Artificial Intelligence (AI) appears to be an ingredient people obsess themselves with, wanting to add it to software like salt to fries. However,often times they forget that adding too much salt can cause hypertension in the long run, an understanding our team embraced - with brilliant foresight. 

> "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."
>  -Leonardo Da Vinci  

A simple press of a button to remind one of hydrating onself gets the message across in an engaging way.
